# Team-Profile-Generator

This repository is for a Team Profile Generator application. 

In this application, you can generate a HTML webpage that displays your team's basic information.
  
In the command-line terminal, you can type the information of your team. To start the application, type "node index.js" in the terminal.      
  
First of all, you can type in the name, id, email and office number of the manager. After that, the application will ask if you would like to add an engineer or an intern to the team. Just like how you type in the information for the manager except the office number, the only difference is engineer will be asked for their Github username, intern will be asked for their school name. After every addition of employee, the application will ask if you would like to add another employee to the team.

A index.html will be created after you finished inputting.                       
With the Github section, you can click into the Github link that open in a new tab. Also, when you click on the email of the team, your default email program will open and their email address will be in the TO field of the email.
